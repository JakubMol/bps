This README file describes the uses for the files included in the delivered zip file.


When the data custodian is Geoscience Australia or the Geological Survey of Western Australia 
the '.txt' file contains the licence agreement between the data custodian and the user of the data.
By opening the zip file you accept the conditions defined in the text licence file.

For datasets where the data custodian is the Commonwealth of Australia the '.pdf' file is:

	the catalogue of the specifications of all airborne geophysical surveys conducted by or for the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments.
	The catalogue is referenced as Richardson, L. M., 2003 - Index of Airborne Geophysical Surveys, Seventh Edition. Geoscience Australia, Australia, Record 2003/10.

For datasets where the data custodian is New South Wales or Queensland or Victoria the '.pdf' file is:

	the licence agreement between the data custodian and the user of the data.
	By opening the zip file you accept the conditions defined in the PDF licence file.

Vector data is supplied in three files - '.dat', '.des' and '.dfn'.

The '.dat' file contains the located geophysical data.
The '.des' file contains specification details for the datum and projection of the geophysical data.
The '.dfn' file contains the format information of the geophysical data.

Gridded data is supplied in ErMapper format.  Each grid has two files - a data file and an associated header ('.ers') file. 

For both vector and gridded datasets the filenames all contain the standard Geoscience Australia airborne survey project number.

Eg. P346MAG.dat is the ASCII columns magnetic data file for the Central Great Artesian Basin airborne survey.
    P569tmig is the tmi grid file for the Dubbo airborne survey.
    P569tmig.ers is the tmi grid header file for the Dubbo airborne survey.

Gravity data

A '.doc' file is supplied with all gravity datasets that contains information on the data format, field descriptions, data quality, gravity datum and gravity data processing.

For gravity point-located datasets the filenames in the zip file are:

GRAVITY_DB_AAGD07_imported3.dat
GRAVITY_DB_AAGD07_imported3.des
GRAVITY_DB_AAGD07_imported3.dfn
GRAVITY_DB_AAGD07_imported3.pdf
GRAVITY_DB_AAGD07_imported3.README (is a PDF file)


A catalogue of gravity surveys which provides the specifications of gravity surveys held in the Australian National Gravity Database
